# Example of decentralized app

Here is a tutorial on how you can create and deploy your own dapp on php coin network.

As an example we will create an app that login users to blockchain with gateway api and allows them to check balance (public API access).

Also as an example of private access we will allow the user to store its address label on a node.

Address will be stored in the node internal database but other nodes can access it through the dapp API.

This is not an example of full decentralized storage, but it will show basic principles of this concept.

This app when published can run on any node, but storing address labels will be only on the node owner.

Then the app will be used to show a label of address on other nodes.

Full deployed dapp is available on address:
